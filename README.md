# Netflix Clone  

This is a clone of the Netflix homepage as it appeared around November, 2024. It was created for educational purposes while following a tutorial by [CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry). The project demonstrates basic web development skills using HTML and CSS.

## Features  
- **Static UI**: Replicates the look of the Netflix homepage.  
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes (to the best of my ability).  
- **HTML & CSS**: Built purely using HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript functionality.

---

## Purpose  
- To practice and improve my HTML and CSS skills.  
- To understand the structure and styling of a professional-grade web page.

## Known Issues  
- Some minor alignment issues may persist.  
- Responsiveness might not be perfect on all devices.
